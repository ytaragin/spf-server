Tight Ends:
Earl Cooper
Walt Arnold
Dave Casper
Wide Receivers:
Johnny Lam Jones
Alfred Jackson
Mike Renfro
Mike Mosley
Julius Dawkins
Running Backs:
Butch Woolfolk
Bo Robinson
Whether they were missing
from just my set, or the
actual print run from
Avalon Hill, I used their
stats to create a
replacement card for each
