Players Marked with * have
been added to the set
manually as they couldn’t
be found in my set.
Initially I thought my set
was incomplete but two
other people were missing
the same cards so I can
only assume that there was
a problem with some of the
print runs for this set.
In any case, as a Redskins
fan, there was no way I
was letting Dave Butz go
missing from the awesome
Redskins defense of that
year!
