Players marked with a *
here are suggested
upgrades to the cards
shown. The Redskins
defense allowed only 80
rushing yards per game in
1983, by far the best in
the NFL. It is ridiculous
in my opinion that their
LB’s are listed at-2,-2
and -1, among the worst
groups in the whole card
set. It’s up to you which
you use, but I’ve listed
them all with -3 tackle
ratings to beef up the
Redskins run defense to an
appropriate level in my
opinion
